					<h1> Study: Fusion energy could play a major role in the global response to climate change</h1>
					<p> For many decades, fusion has been touted as the ultimate source of abundant, clean electricity. Now, as the world faces the need to reduce carbon emissions to prevent catastrophic climate change, making commercial fusion power a reality takes on new importance. In a power system dominated by low-carbon variable renewable energy sources (VREs) such as solar and wind, ‚Äúfirm‚Äù electricity sources are needed to kick in whenever demand exceeds supply ‚Äî for example, when the sun isn‚Äôt shining or the wind isn‚Äôt blowing and energy storage systems aren‚Äôt up to the task. What is the potential role and value of fusion power plants (FPPs) in such a future electric power system ‚Äî a system that is not only free of carbon emissions but also capable of meeting the dramatically increased global electricity demand expected in the coming decades?</p></br>
					<p>Working together for a year-and-a-half, investigators in the MIT Energy Initiative (MITEI) and the MIT Plasma Science and Fusion Center (PSFC) have been collaborating to answer that question. They found that ‚Äî depending on its future cost and performance ‚Äî fusion has the potential to be critically important to decarbonization. Under some conditions, the availability of FPPs could reduce the global cost of decarbonizing by trillions of dollars. More than 25 experts together examined the factors that will impact the deployment of FPPs, including costs, climate policy, operating characteristics, and other factors. They present their findings in a new report funded through MITEI and entitled <I>‚ÄúThe Role of Fusion Energy in a Decarbonized Electricity System.‚Äù</I></p></br>
					<p><I>‚ÄúRight now, there is great interest in fusion energy in many quarters ‚Äî from the private sector to government to the general public,‚Äù</I> says the study‚Äôs principal investigator (PI) Robert C. Armstrong, MITEI‚Äôs former director and the Chevron Professor of Chemical Engineering, Emeritus. ‚ÄúIn undertaking this study, our goal was to provide a balanced, fact-based, analysis-driven guide to help us all understand the prospects for fusion going forward.‚Äù Accordingly, the study takes a multidisciplinary approach that combines economic modeling, electric grid modeling, techno-economic analysis, and more to examine important factors that are likely to shape the future deployment and utilization of fusion energy. The investigators from MITEI provided the energy systems modeling capability, while the PSFC participants provided the fusion expertise.</p></br>
					<p>Fusion technologies may be a decade away from commercial deployment, so the detailed technology and costs of future commercial FPPs are not known at this point. As a result, the MIT research team focused on determining what cost levels fusion plants must reach by 2050 to achieve strong market penetration and make a significant contribution to the decarbonization of global electricity supply in the latter half of the century.</p></br>
					<p>The value of having FPPs available on an electric grid will depend on what other options are available, so to perform their analyses, the researchers needed estimates of the future cost and performance of those options, including conventional fossil fuel generators, nuclear fission power plants, VRE generators, and energy storage technologies, as well as electricity demand for specific regions of the world. To find the most reliable data, they searched the published literature as well as results of previous MITEI and PSFC analyses.</p></br>
					<p>Overall, the analyses showed that ‚Äî while the technology demands of harnessing fusion energy are formidable ‚Äî so are the potential economic and environmental payoffs of adding this firm, low-carbon technology to the world‚Äôs portfolio of energy options.</p></br>
					<p>Perhaps the most remarkable finding is the <I>‚Äúsocietal value‚Äù</I> of having commercial FPPs available. <I>‚ÄúLimiting warming to 1.5 degrees C requires that the world invest in wind, solar, storage, grid infrastructure, and everything else needed to decarbonize the electric power system,‚Äù </I> explains Randall Field, executive director of the fusion study and MITEI‚Äôs director of research. <I>‚ÄúThe cost of that task can be far lower when FPPs are available as a source of clean, firm electricity.‚Äù</I> And the benefit varies depending on the cost of the FPPs. For example, assuming that the cost of building a FPP is $8,000 per kilowatt (kW) in 2050 and falls to $4,300/kW in 2100, the global cost of decarbonizing electric power drops by $3.6 trillion. If the cost of a FPP is $5,600/kW in 2050 and falls to $3,000/kW in 2100, the savings from having the fusion plants available would be $8.7 trillion. (Those calculations are based on differences in global gross domestic product and assume a discount rate of 6 percent. The undiscounted value is about 20 times larger.)</p></br>
					<p>The goal of other analyses was to determine the scale of deployment worldwide at selected FPP costs. Again, the results are striking. For a deep decarbonization scenario, the total global share of electricity generation from fusion in 2100 ranges from less than 10 percent if the cost of fusion is high to more than 50 percent if the cost of fusion is low.</p></br>
					<p>Other analyses showed that the scale and timing of fusion deployment vary in different parts of the world. Early deployment of fusion can be expected in wealthy nations such as European countries and the United States that have the most aggressive decarbonization policies. But certain other locations ‚Äî for example, India and the continent of Africa ‚Äî will have great growth in fusion deployment in the second half of the century due to a large increase in demand for electricity during that time. <I>‚ÄúIn the U.S. and Europe, the amount of demand growth will be low, so it‚Äôll be a matter of switching away from dirty fuels to fusion,‚Äù</I> explains Sergey Paltsev, deputy director of the MIT Center for Sustainability Science and Strategy and a senior research scientist at MITEI. <I>‚ÄúBut in India and Africa, for example, the tremendous growth in overall electricity demand will be met with significant amounts of fusion along with other low-carbon generation resources in the later part of the century.‚Äù</I></p></br>
					<p>A set of analyses focusing on nine subregions of the United States showed that the availability and cost of other low-carbon technologies, as well as how tightly carbon emissions are constrained, have a major impact on how FPPs would be deployed and used. In a decarbonized world, FPPs will have the highest penetration in locations with poor diversity, capacity, and quality of renewable resources, and limits on carbon emissions will have a big impact. For example, the Atlantic and Southeast subregions have low renewable resources. In those subregions, wind can produce only a small fraction of the electricity needed, even with maximum onshore wind buildout. Thus, fusion is needed in those subregions, even when carbon constraints are relatively lenient, and any available FPPs would be running much of the time. In contrast, the Central subregion of the United States has excellent renewable resources, especially wind. Thus, fusion competes in the Central subregion only when limits on carbon emissions are very strict, and FPPs will typically be operated only when the renewables can‚Äôt meet demand.</p></br>
					<p>An analysis of the power system that serves the New England states provided remarkably detailed results. Using a modeling tool developed at MITEI, the fusion team explored the impact of using different assumptions about not just cost and emissions limits but even such details as potential land-use constraints affecting the use of specific VREs. This approach enabled them to calculate the FPP cost at which fusion units begin to be installed. They were also able to investigate how that ‚Äúthreshold‚Äù cost changed with changes in the cap on carbon emissions. The method can even show at what price FPPs begin to replace other specific generating sources. In one set of runs, they determined the cost at which FPPs would begin to displace floating platform offshore wind and rooftop solar.</p></br>
					<p><I>‚ÄúThis study is an important contribution to fusion commercialization because it provides economic targets for the use of fusion in the electricity markets,‚Äù notes Dennis G. Whyte, co-PI of the fusion study, former director of the PSFC, and the Hitachi America Professor of Engineering in the Department of Nuclear Science and Engineering. ‚ÄúIt better quantifies the technical design challenges for fusion developers with respect to pricing, availability, and flexibility to meet changing demand in the future.‚Äù</I></p></br>
					<p>The researchers stress that while fission power plants are included in the analyses, they did not perform a ‚Äúhead-to-head‚Äù comparison between fission and fusion, because there are too many unknowns. Fusion and nuclear fission are both firm, low-carbon electricity-generating technologies; but unlike fission, fusion doesn‚Äôt use fissile materials as fuels, and it doesn‚Äôt generate long-lived nuclear fuel waste that must be managed. As a result, the regulatory requirements for FPPs will be very different from the regulations for today‚Äôs fission power plants ‚Äî but precisely how they will differ is unclear. Likewise, the future public perception and social acceptance of each of these technologies cannot be projected, but could have a major influence on what generation technologies are used to meet future demand.</p></br>
					<p>The results of the study convey several messages about the future of fusion. For example, it‚Äôs clear that regulation can be a potentially large cost driver. This should motivate fusion companies to minimize their regulatory and environmental footprint with respect to fuels and activated materials. It should also encourage governments to adopt appropriate and effective regulatory policies to maximize their ability to use fusion energy in achieving their decarbonization goals. And for companies developing fusion technologies, the study‚Äôs message is clearly stated in the report: <I>‚ÄúIf the cost and performance targets identified in this report can be achieved, our analysis shows that fusion energy can play a major role in meeting future electricity needs and achieving global net-zero carbon goals.‚Äù</I></p></br>
